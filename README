An implementation of a stochastic simulation algorithm (more commonly known as
the Gillespie algorithm) after

D. T. Gillespie, Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions. 
J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340â€“2361 (1977).

As it stands, the program reproduces the data for the Lokia simulation 
(Figures 8,9) and the Brusselator (Figure 14) from that paper.
